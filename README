Math with strings that are represented by big integers

(C) ..--- ----- ----- .---- by - . .-.. ... .-.-.-  All rights reserved.

This package complements Math::String with a charset that takes as the
"character" a sorted list of words in a file, each word on a separate line.

See INSTALL on how to unpack and install this package.

You will very likely need newer versions of Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat.

See also ./examples for some example scripts.
