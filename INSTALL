Math with strings that are represented by big integers

(C) ..--- ----- ----- .---- by - . .-.. ... .-.-.-  All rights reserved.

You need the new Math::BigInt and Math::BigFloat versions of at least v1.33 as
they can be found on CPAN or in perl newer than v5.7.1.

To install, untar, unzip and then run

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test

If all tests pass, you might do:

	make install

to install this package.

See also ./examples for some example scripts.

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
