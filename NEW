This lists only the changes for the current release (v0.05) over the last
version, since CHANGES is now quite big:

* if record len was 0, _record() bombed (buffer underflow)
* dictionaries with more than 8192 bytes did not work, due to bug in offset
  reading
* num2str() did not work for negative numbers (abs() missing)
* more tests
* we need Test::Simple, so list it in Makefile.PL
